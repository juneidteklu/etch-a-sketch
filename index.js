/*
 Store the dimensions of etch-sqaures (700px) into a variable named etchSquaresDimension.
 Get a number from the user and perform the following calculation: 
    - Dvide 700px by the number provided by user (with var name num);
    - Store that value into variable divSquareDimension;
    - create num * num amount of squares with the height and width of divSquareDimension;
    - appendChild each of those squares into the etch-squares container;
    - flex-wrap must be applied to etch-squares container for this to work properly;
    - etch-squares container dimensions need to remain fixed for this to work properly;
